    <h1><center>My Favorite Car</center></h1>
    <h1>I like this car for its speed, for its style and because it is one of the most loved cars in the world</h1>
    <h1>My favorite color for this car is blue</h1>
    <h1>With a top speed of 320 km/h (318 km/h with PDK) it is even faster than its predecessor 911 GT3 RS. The new 911 GT3 accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 3.4 seconds. For a particularly purist driving experience, Porsche also offers the new model with a six-speed gearbox.</h1>
